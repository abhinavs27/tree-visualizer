# Tree Visualizer

Web app built using HTML/CSS/JS(ES6) built to visualize tree data structures. The project's initial scope was intended to implement multiple different trees, but over time this was changed to implement just Binary Search Trees with the potential to implement more in the future.

See a working demo here!
